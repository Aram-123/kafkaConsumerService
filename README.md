# kafkaConsumerService

This project listens to data from a Kafka topic and saves it to a database. It uses Spring Boot, Spring Kafka, and a PostgreSQL database for persistence.


## Features

- Listens to Kafka topics for incoming messages.
- Deserializes JSON messages.
- Handles deserialization errors gracefully.
- Persists messages to a relational database.

The application uses SLF4J for logging. Logs are configured to be written to the console.
